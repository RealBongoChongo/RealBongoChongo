# About Me
I've been a developer for 4+ years and I'm mainly fluent in Python, Javascript, and Luau. I create things ranging from Discord bots to Roblox games to Discord bot dashboards. I use tools such as MongoDB, SQLite, Bootstrap, and jQuery. If you want to see some of the projects I've made, you can head over to my [portfolio](https://realbongochongo.github.io).

- Deadlines- I don't want to be stressed trying to make a deadline
## What You Need To Do
- Keep my credits in the files/scripts

## Payment
My costs will vary depending on what kind of commission you are asking for and the time/effort needed for that commission. All payments are done upfront and full refunds are issued if I run into an issue that I am unable to get around such as IRL issues, the customer is requesting one midway through the process, or the customer did not get what they wanted.

I prefer paypal as a payment method, but if you would like to give me robux for roblox-based commissions, I will take that as well.
